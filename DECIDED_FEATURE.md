# Decided Feature Implementation Guide

## 1. Overview

The "Decided" feature is a real-time, collaborative movie selection system designed to solve the common problem of two people spending excessive time choosing what to watch together. It uses a tournament-style bracket, ELO-based movie ratings, and real-time communication via Supabase to create a fun and engaging experience.

## 2. Core Concepts

- **Rooms**: A private, collaborative session initiated by one user and joined by another.
- **Tournament Bracket**: A single-elimination tournament generated from the combined movie watchlists of both participants.
- **Pairwise Comparison**: Users are presented with pairs of movies and must choose their preference, which advances one movie to the next round.
- **ELO Rating**: Movie preferences are recorded using an ELO rating system, which helps refine future recommendations.
- **Real-time Sync**: The entire experience is synchronized in real-time between participants using Supabase Realtime Channels.
