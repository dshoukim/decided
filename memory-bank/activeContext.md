# Active Context: Decided

## Current Focus: Enhanced Movie Data Infrastructure & Web Scraping Capabilities

### Status: Production Ready Application with Advanced Movie Data Pipeline
The Decided application has achieved **production readiness** with all core tournament features working reliably. Recent focus has expanded movie database infrastructure to include **comprehensive Rotten Tomatoes integration** with enhanced web scraping capabilities for critic reviews, scores, and intelligent URL handling.

## Recent Major Changes

### Enhanced Rotten Tomatoes Scraper Implementation (Latest)
1. **Comprehensive RT Data Extraction**
   - Enhanced scraper with score extraction (Tomato Meter + Audience Score)
   - Working critic review extraction with updated RT HTML selectors
   - Support for top critics, regular critics, and audience reviews
   - Full review data including reviewer names, publications, dates, and review text

3. **Film List Processing Tools**
   - Created conversion script (`convert-films-list.ts`) for large movie datasets
   - Processes 3,000+ movie titles with year normalization and deduplication
   - Generates JSON arrays compatible with TMDB population script

### Phase 6 Completion (Previously Finished)
1. **Tournament Completion Architecture**
   - Implemented `isFinalRound` and `finalMovies` fields in Tournament interface
   - Added automatic detection of final round (exactly 2 winners remaining)
   - Created `checkFinalPicksComplete()` method to detect when both users complete final round

2. **Event Broadcasting Enhancement**
   - Added `final_round_started` and `tournament_completed` events
   - Enhanced bracket API to auto-trigger winner determination
   - Implemented comprehensive real-time event system
