# Product Context: Decided

## Problem Statement

### The Core Problem
Couples and friends constantly face the "what should we watch tonight?" dilemma. Traditional methods of deciding - scrolling through Netflix together, taking turns choosing, or endless back-and-forth discussions - are inefficient and often lead to decision fatigue or one person's preferences dominating.

### Specific Pain Points
1. **Decision Paralysis**: Overwhelming number of choices leads to spending more time choosing than watching
2. **Preference Imbalance**: One person's taste often dominates, leading to dissatisfaction
3. **Discovery Limitation**: People tend to stick to familiar genres/actors, missing great content
4. **Time Waste**: 20-30 minutes of scrolling and discussing before starting to watch
5. **Remote Coordination**: Long-distance couples/friends can't easily collaborate on movie choices

## Solution Overview

### Our Approach
Decided transforms movie selection from a passive browsing experience into an engaging, fair, and efficient collaborative game. By using tournament-style pairwise comparisons, we leverage psychological principles that make decision-making easier and more accurate.

### Why Tournament Style Works
- **Cognitive Ease**: Comparing two options is psychologically simpler than ranking many
- **Revealed Preferences**: Choices reflect true preferences better than rating systems
- **Engagement**: Gamification makes the selection process enjoyable rather than tedious
- **Fairness**: Both participants have equal influence on the final outcome
- **Speed**: Structured progression eliminates endless browsing

## Target Users

### Primary Personas

**The Collaborative Couple**
- Living together or in long-distance relationships
- Both active in entertainment choices

- Want to discover new content together

**The Friendship Group**
- Close friends who regularly watch movies together
- Different taste preferences within the group
- Meet regularly (virtual or in-person) for movie nights

### User Journey

1. **Setup Phase**: Users sign in and build their personal watchlists through movie rating
2. **Invitation Phase**: One user creates a room and shares the code with their partner
3. **Tournament Phase**: Both users participate in real-time pairwise movie comparisons
4. **Resolution Phase**: System determines winner based on both users' choices
5. **Outcome Phase**: Winning movie is added to both users' watchlists for easy access

## Value Propositions

## Market Context
