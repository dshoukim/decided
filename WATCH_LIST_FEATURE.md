   psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f database-setup.sql
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   Ensure you have TMDB API access configured:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_tmdb_bearer_token
   # OR
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
   ```

### üêõ Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **TMDB API Errors**: Verify environment variables are correctly set
2. **Database Permissions**: Ensure RLS policies are properly configured
3. **Auto-Population Not Working**: Check that movie_ratings table has "not_seen" entries
4. **Streaming Data Missing**: This is expected - TMDB has limited streaming provider data

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify Supabase connection and authentication
3. Test TMDB API access independently
4. Check database table structure and data

### üìä Performance Considerations

1. **API Optimization**
   - Debounced search prevents excessive API calls
   - Cached TMDB responses where appropriate
   - Batch operations for database updates

2. **Image Loading**
   - Optimized poster image sizes
   - Fallback images for missing posters
   - Lazy loading for large watch lists

3. **Database Efficiency**
   - Proper indexing on search columns
   - Efficient query patterns
   - Row-level security for data isolation

The watch list feature provides a comprehensive movie management experience that integrates seamlessly with the existing survey and recommendation system.
