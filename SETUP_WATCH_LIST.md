# Quick Setup Guide: Watch List Feature

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone and Set Up the Project

1. Open your terminal and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/decided.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

### Step 2: Set up the Database
Run the SQL commands in `database-setup.sql` to create the `watch_list` table:

```

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables
Make sure you have TMDB API access configured in your `.env.local`:

```env
# You need at least one of these:
NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_tmdb_bearer_token
# OR
NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key

# Also ensure your Supabase variables are set:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

cd supabase-auth
npm run dev
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

**No auto-populated movies?**
- Make sure you completed the movie survey with "Haven't Seen" ratings
- Check database for entries in `movie_ratings` table with `rating_type = 'not_seen'`

**Search not working?**
- Verify TMDB API credentials in environment variables
- Check browser console for API errors
- Test TMDB API directly: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?query=test`

**Streaming info not showing?**
- This is expected - TMDB has limited streaming provider data
- Feature works but may show "Streaming information not available"

**Database errors?**
- Ensure `watch_list` table exists and has proper RLS policies
- Check that user is authenticated
- Verify Supabase connection
